# NAG Fortran Compiler

## Function

According to the 2015 Fortran UK compiler comparisons, the NAG Fortran compiler is one of the best diagnostic compilers available: http://www.fortran.uk/fortran-compiler-comparisons-2015/intellinux-fortran-compiler-diagnostic-capabilities/

The Windows and Mac versions of the NAG compiler have a graphical user interface and contain full documentation for the Fortran language. 
Combined with the fact that students can install it on their personal machines, this makes it an ideal compiler for teaching and learning Fortran. 
Unfortunately, the Linux version is command line only and so is not as easy to use.
